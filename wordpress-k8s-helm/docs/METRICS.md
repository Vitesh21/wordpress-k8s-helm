# Required Metrics for WordPress, Apache, and Nginx

## WordPress Metrics
1. **Request Metrics**
   - Total Requests
   - Requests per Second
   - Average Response Time
   - 2xx Response Count
   - 4xx Response Count
   - 5xx Response Count

2. **Database Metrics**
   - Active Connections
   - Queries per Second
   - Slow Queries Count
   - Query Response Time

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU Usage
   - Memory Usage
   - Disk I/O

## Nginx Metrics
1. **Request Metrics**
   - Total Request Count
   - Total 5xx Requests
   - Total 4xx Requests
   - Request Latency (Response Time)

2. **Connection Metrics**
   - Active Connections
   - Accepted Connections
   - Handled Connections

3. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU Usage
   - Memory Usage

## Apache Metrics (if applicable)
1. **Request Metrics**
   - Total Requests
   - Requests per Second
   - Average Response Time
   - 2xx Response Count
   - 4xx Response Count
   - 5xx Response Count

2. **Resource Utilization**
   - CPU Usage

   - Disk I/O

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up alerts for high CPU usage, high memory usage, and high response times.
- Monitor error rates (4xx and 5xx) to identify potential issues with the application.
- Use Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics collected from Prometheus.

## Conclusion
This document outlines the key metrics to monitor for the WordPress application, Nginx, and Apache (if used). Implementing these metrics will help ensure the application runs smoothly and any issues can be addressed promptly.
